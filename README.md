## Free CDN List:
#### [jsDelivr](https://jsdelivr.net)
#### [statically](https://statically.io/)

## Make the link into cdn link:

Try [freecdn](https://github.com/EtherDream/freecdn/)

for example:
```
https://github.com/lsyyyy11/cdn-fictional-memory/main/README.md
```
into 

```
https://cdn.statically.io/gh/lsyyyy11/cdn-fictional-memory/main/README.md
```
Because of the Statically CDN will cache files for 1 year, 
so we suggest you to save the files in these branch:

`main` `master` `dev` `develop` `gh-pages`
